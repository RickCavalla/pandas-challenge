Trends from Heroes of Pymoli:

1).  Despite being a significant minority in game, women/other spend about 10% more on average than Men.
Is this just noise from a small sample set?  Do women/other spend more in game precisely because of imbalance and feel pressure to
buy more items to compete with men?  Or would this trend continue?  Game developer might want to do more research because if trend
were to continue, advertising more to women/other could be a good idea as they might be more lucrative customers.

2).  Out of 780 item sales, the item with most sales only sold 12 times.  This seems to indicate that the items offered are balanced,
with none having so much appeal it crowds out the others.  However, there is no data on all items, only those that sold.  While
the items that sold seem balanced, we do not know if the game developer has spent time on 1000s of items and only 183 have ever sold.

3).  Players ages 20-24 are responsible for almost half of totals sales, and players 15-29 placed the vast majority of purchases.
The game developer should consider whether they are happy with this focused trend or if trying to bring in more players of various ages
would benefit the game.
